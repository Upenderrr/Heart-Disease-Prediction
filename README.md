Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

Introduction:
The goal of this project is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical and demographic features. Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early prediction can help in timely medical intervention, potentially saving lives. This project aims to build a predictive model that can classify whether or not a patient has heart disease based on a set of features.

Problem Statement:
Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all
irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical data for better
future preparation.
Do ETL: Extract- Transform and Load data from the heart disease diagnostic database
You can perform EDA through python. The database extracts various information such as
Heart disease rates, Heart disease by gender, by age.
You can even compare attributes of the data set to extract necessary information. Make the
necessary dashboard with the best you can extract from the data. Use various visualization
and features and make the best dashboard
Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes.
Do your own research and come up with your findings.

Results and Analysis:
The analysis would involve comparing model performance and selecting the model that best balances all evaluation metrics. Graphical analysis, like ROC curves, confusion matrices, or feature importance plots, can offer insights into model effectiveness and feature contributions.
